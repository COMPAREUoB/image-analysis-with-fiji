# Description: 

FIJI is a very popular image analysis software application, often described as a ‘batteries included’ distribution of ImageJ. This course aims to cover the basics of FIJI as well as enabling the novice user to make use of sophisticated plugins. Worked examples will be focussed on fluorescence microscopy and include image de-noising, spot detection and co-localisation analysis. 

# Aims

During this course you will learn about:

    Basic image manipulation with FIJI, including opening and saving microscopy file formats.
    Image de-noising, spot detection and co-localisation analysis.
    Installing and using specialist plugins.
    Creating image based figures for publication. 
    
# Objectives

After this course you should be able to:

    Perform routine image analysis with ImageJ/FIJI.
    Find and use research level plugins.
    Add scale bars and make panelled image figures.
