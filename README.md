# Description: 

FIJI is a very popular image analysis software application, often described as a ‘batteries included’ distribution of ImageJ. This course aims to cover the basics of FIJI as well as enabling the novice user to make use of sophisticated plugins. Worked examples will be focussed on fluorescence microscopy and include image de-noising, spot detection and co-localisation analysis. 

# Aims

During this course you will learn about:

    Basic image manipulation with FIJI, including opening and saving microscopy file formats.
    Image de-noising, spot detection and co-localisation analysis.
    Installing and using specialist plugins.
    Creating image based figures for publication. 
    
# Objectives

After this course you should be able to:

    Perform routine image analysis with ImageJ/FIJI.
    Find and use research level plugins.
    Add scale bars and make panelled image figures. 

# Software

For convenience, we have created a Virtual Machine that will run all the relevant software and plugins within a unix environment. You can run this virtual machine by first [downloading](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) the latest version of VirtualBox for your operating system. 

N.B. if you an older version of your operating system, you may wish to download an [older version](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_3) of VirtualBox.


You can now download the latest version of the Virtual Machine from here...
